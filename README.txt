Gachaverse Chat Spam Script
Discovered by Goldenwind and programmed my Tiber Septim (nullfact0r) of the Anti Gacha Life Council

==WARNING==
Lunime discovered this exploit and shut down their chat servers since they didn't know how to patch it, so until their servers come back online, this exploit is defunct.

+=EXPLOIT=+
The way this exploit works is it spams HTTP POST requests to Lunime's backend containing a custom message, raw HTTP POST data can be found here: [https://pastebin.com/raw/EixdNSDX]. The variable chatx is the message sent to chat, namex is the username used when posting, and channelx is the channel to post to.
